    CPU Frequency Or CPU clock speed:-
    It is number of clock cycles performed by a cpu in a second
    Measure in Hz(1 cycle per second)
    Ghz :- giga Hz is 1billion cycles per second
    Clock cycle is single electrical pulse passing in cpu 
    Using this one pulse cpu performs basic operation like accessing memeory,ready data.
    Number of cycles varies from Instruction to Instruction
